This is the README document that sits at the top of every repository.  A repository is a place where code is stored.

## Useful Information

For more information about the Processing language, visit http://www.processing.org

There are many other languages that are fun to learn and excellent for beginners.  Ruby is one of our favorites.

Are you into Minecraft?  There are some really great resources for learning the language Python while doing cool stuff inside Minecraft.  My favorite is the book *Adventures In Minecraft*, by Martin O'Hanlon and David Whale (Wiley Books, 2015).  It takes some work, but the rewards are great.  Bonus:  They'll also show you how to host your own Minecraft server on a Raspberry Pi (a tiny $35 computer).
